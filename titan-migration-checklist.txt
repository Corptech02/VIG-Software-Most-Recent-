TITAN EMAIL MIGRATION CHECKLIST
Ask GoDaddy Support These Questions:
================================================

BEFORE MIGRATION:
□ Will IMAP be automatically enabled on Titan?
□ Will my current password (25nickc124) work or will I get a new one?
□ How long will email be down during migration?
□ Will my existing emails transfer over?
□ Can I create app passwords in Titan?
□ Is there a trial period if it doesn't work?
□ Confirm username format: "contact@vigagency.com" or just "contact"?

CONFIRM THESE SETTINGS:
□ IMAP Server: imap.secureserver.net
□ IMAP Port: 993 with SSL
□ SMTP Server: smtpout.secureserver.net
□ SMTP Port: 587 with TLS
□ Authentication: Basic auth or app password?

GET IN WRITING:
□ "Titan Email includes full IMAP support"
□ "IMAP will work immediately after migration"
□ "No additional configuration needed for IMAP"

AFTER MIGRATION:
□ Test login to webmail first
□ Note down any new password
□ Test IMAP connection immediately
□ Keep support ticket open until confirmed working

================================================
IMPORTANT: Get them to confirm IMAP will work
BEFORE you migrate. Don't migrate until they
guarantee IMAP access!
