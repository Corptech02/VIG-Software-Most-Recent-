QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR IT ADMIN
===============================================

You gave me the server settings (which are correct), but the authentication is still failing.
Here are the specific questions to ask:

1. "Is basic authentication enabled for IMAP on our Office 365 tenant?"
   - This is the #1 issue - Microsoft disabled it by default in Oct 2022
   - If disabled, IMAP won't work with passwords

2. "Is IMAP protocol enabled for the account contact@vigagency.com?"
   - Can be disabled per-user or organization-wide
   - Check in Exchange Admin Center > Recipients > Mailboxes > [User] > Mailbox features

3. "Do we enforce Modern Authentication only (OAuth2)?"
   - If yes, password auth won't work for IMAP
   - Would need to use OAuth2 flow instead

4. "Are there any Conditional Access policies blocking IMAP?"
   - Some orgs block IMAP from external IPs
   - Or require specific conditions (compliant device, etc.)

5. "Should I create an app-specific password?"
   - If 2FA is enabled, might need app password
   - Created in security settings of the account

6. "Can you check the sign-in logs for contact@vigagency.com?"
   - They can see exactly why authentication is failing
   - Azure AD > Sign-in logs will show the specific error

===============================================
WHAT TO TELL YOUR IT ADMIN
===============================================

"I'm trying to connect to contact@vigagency.com via IMAP from our application server.
The connection works but authentication fails with 'LOGIN failed' error.
I'm using the correct password and the settings you provided:
- Server: outlook.office365.com
- Port: 993 with TLS
- Username: contact@vigagency.com
- Password: [correct password]

Can you check if basic authentication is enabled for IMAP and if there are any policies blocking this?"

===============================================
IF THEY SAY "BASIC AUTH IS DISABLED"
===============================================

Ask: "Can you either:
1. Enable basic auth for IMAP for this specific account, OR
2. Create an app password for this account, OR
3. Help me set up OAuth2 authentication with app registration in Azure AD?"
