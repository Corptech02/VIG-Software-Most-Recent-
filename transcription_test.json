  "raw_text": " Oh, no. Yeah. Hey, Chris, don't worry, my man. Yeah, this is this. This is down from the UIG, where base that a bronze-ochoile hired. The reason for my calls, they noticed your trucking insurance is in your expiration, and I believe under us you'd be eligible for not only better coverage, but for a better place. With that being said, how much you currently pay him off my man? Oh, I don't know. I paid quarterly, I paid. I don't know. I paid about 90. I don't know 90's come to a thousand a year. Yeah, we could beat that price for sure for you, my man. How many trucks do you drive? I have six. Okay, nice, nice. Do you have an email for me? It's CST 6985 at live.com. Awesome. All right, I'm going to get you a quote right away here now, and I got your email going on. Okay. I need a little bit in for first from you here, and then we'll get your quote going on. How many trailers do you have? Um, I think I've eight. Sorry. I think I've eight or nine, I guess. Eight, I think. And how long have you had your CDL for, don't you, man? I asked you, Graham probably, I'm with a silver, you know, so I said this. That's probably the CDL for winner or star. Wow, so you've been in this industry for a long time, huh? 40 years. Wow, well, I really appreciate it, sir. I mean, it's incredible. Well, where are the makes and models of that are on those trucks there? 10, where's three can, where's three peer builds? Nice. What do you got? A 379. A couple three, totally nine, the 389 and then three, you got me a nine. Nice. Those run a well for you? Yep. Awesome. It's good to hear. And how old are you, my man? 59. 59. Yep. How far do you typically drive? Um, we're based out of green with so high. We are usually within a 300 mile radius. Okay. Okay. We step, might step out just a couple miles. The Chicago is probably about the farthest that we go right now. Okay. Nice. Nice. Now, you mean, estimate here, what's the average value? Those trucks and trailers, would you say each? Um, I don't know. The average value on the truck, I think I haven't valued around 70 to 80,000. One of them is valued probably at 150 could even be 200. Okay. Okay. It's a 20, 20, 389 Peter Bill Guider. Okay. Sorry. I'm just John down a couple things here. Is that what it means? Yeah. So what do you typically call my man? What do you, what do you usually do? We all scrap and crust glass. Scraping. Fresh glass. Nice. Don't throw it. There it was. Yeah, just running loads. Yeah. Would you say the value is on those dumped? Um, I have one I think that is valued at, I have two, or one of the value that I think at 140, another one that's valued at 130. And let's see. I have one that's probably only valued at 120. I have a two that are valued at probably 80. Um, and the other ones are, which I have a couple of them for sale. So they're probably valued around 60. Oh, very nice. Very nice. Okay, perfect. We got everything we need here. So I'm going to give you a call back with a quote. And, uh, so yeah, you got any other questions for me? Uh, nope. I'm not sure what, I'm not exactly sure what I have for liability, but I know I have to have 100,000 cargo. So. Yeah, I was assuming it's paid minimum. Uh, yeah. Maybe. Is there any specific or special coverage there? Um, I, you know what, I'm not exactly sure. Um, I don't have, you know, I guess I am in the shop today. So I have my house. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. I think I have some kind of a million dollar liability, and that's kind of a number. Oh, okay. I'm going to send you with my account manager really quick here. And then, uh, yeah, well, how long did you go? Because we're pretty busy today. That's going to be more work on on top today. So, I don't have a lot of time here. Um, I'm going to send them over to you. Like 15, 20 seconds here. Just give me two seconds. Well, how long is the deal going to take with him? Of course. We're really busy. Probably two minutes. He just got a better and couple things here for him. We'll get it sent over to you. Okay. Hey Chris, how you doing? Good. I'm doing well. Could you get the question? The operation going on here. No, I don't know. I guess. We like to look at it. That way. Well, I'm sure the things are going pretty well for you. So, yeah, my f- One of the agents here seems like they got good amount of information. Now, we could do this two ways because I did hear that you're pretty packed on your time. I don't want to take a much of your time. Yeah. I can get this put this together together on my own time and give any mail and follow it with a call back. Or we can just go through it, quote it, and then I can tell you where we're at. I'm surprised. Yeah. Whatever works for you. Yeah. That's the fact because we got some stuff going on here. We got home coming and we have a shit ton of stuff over there. House. Getting pictures and I, they want to talk with it. Oh, I know how it is. Jeff, Jeff, I'm not out. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's family mail or something. We'll talk. Perfect. And then that's a, that email for you. What is that? We'll be the best email. F-S-T-6-9-8-S-I, that live that time. Perfect. All right. All right. All right. Yeah. I appreciate you. And I'm Chris. You take care.",
