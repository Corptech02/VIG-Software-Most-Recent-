🚨 IMPORTANT: TO SEE THE CHANGES, YOU MUST CLEAR YOUR BROWSER CACHE! 🚨

The changes ARE deployed and working, but your browser is caching old JavaScript files.

To fix this, do ONE of the following:

1. HARD REFRESH (Fastest):
   - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
   - Or hold Shift and click the Reload button

2. CLEAR BROWSER CACHE:
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy → Clear Data → Cached Web Content
   - Safari: Develop menu → Empty Caches

3. OPEN IN INCOGNITO/PRIVATE WINDOW:
   - This will load fresh files without cache

4. DEVELOPER TOOLS METHOD:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Right-click the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

After clearing cache, you should see:
✅ An alert saying "ABSOLUTE TEST" - proving JavaScript is loading
✅ A red banner at the top for 5 seconds
✅ Back button will auto-reload emails instead of showing "Click below to reload"
✅ Console messages starting with 🔴 INLINE FIX ACTIVE

The fix is DEFINITELY deployed - the issue is just browser caching!
