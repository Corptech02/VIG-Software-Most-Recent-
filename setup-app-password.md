# Titan Email App Password Setup

## Why App Password is Needed
Titan email (GoDaddy hosting) requires App Passwords for third-party applications like our CRM system, similar to Gmail.

## Steps to Generate App Password:

### Method 1: GoDaddy Dashboard
1. Login to https://sso.godaddy.com/
2. Go to "My Products" → "Email & Office"
3. Click "Manage" next to your email plan
4. Find contact@vigagency.com → Settings
5. Look for "App Passwords" or "Third-party access"
6. Generate new App Password for "Vanguard CRM"

### Method 2: Direct Email Settings (if available)
1. Go to https://login.secureserver.net/
2. Login with contact@vigagency.com
3. Account Settings → Security
4. Generate App Password

## What to Expect:
- App Password format: `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` (16 chars with dashes)
- This replaces your regular password in the system
- Keep this secure - treat it like a password

## Once You Have the App Password:
Tell me the App Password and I'll update the system configuration.

Current password in system: 25nickc124! (11 chars)
Needed: App Password (usually 16-19 chars with dashes)
